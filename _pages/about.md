When I was a kid, I received many Meccano sets, which helped me develop the skill of structuring a problem to achieve the outcome I had in mind. I loved mathematics as a child, and this passion stayed with me throughout my educational journey.

During my university years, I enjoyed a programming course in my engineering class, and every summer, I sought to learn something new. I explored various areas such as creating Android apps, controlling cars using C and embedded C, and programming with JavaScript. It was fun when I wrote a  2D java game. I discovered data science one year before graduation. Data science combined my love for mathematics, statistics, and programming, while also allowing me to influence business decisions directly. I fell in love with it and have been dedicated to it ever since.

Everything I have achieved in life is something I dreamed of, which is why I am self-motivated. I thrive in teams in which I can enable the lowest voices to be heard and to have the courage to share their ideas. 

I prefer to stay quiet, as it helps me process information faster before reaching a conclusion. However, I’m always happy to share my ideas while developing them when needed. I can switch between logical and creative thinking, but I love seeing the tangible outcomes of my work. My favorite approach is structured creativity—a balanced blend of logic and innovation.

I have a strong attention to details and can turn ambiguous goals into well-structured, sequential steps. I thrive on working toward clear targets.

My ideal team will be a supportive team and they work together to reach a common goal. I thrive with bold leaders who are willing to challenge how things are done and are happy to run experiments to explore potential improvements.
