When I was a kid, I received many Meccano sets, which helped me develop the skill of structuring a problem to achieve the outcome I had in mind. I loved mathematics as a child, and this passion stayed with me throughout my educational journey.

During my university years, I enjoyed a programming course in my engineering class, and every summer, I sought to learn something new. I explored various areas such as creating Android apps, controlling cars using C and embedded C, and programming with JavaScript. I felt proud when my siblings played a 2D game I developed. However, one thing I disliked about programming was that programmers often weren’t included in decision-making processes. This led me to discover data science one year before graduation. Data science combined my love for mathematics, statistics, and programming, while also allowing me to influence business decisions directly. I fell in love with it and have been dedicated to it ever since.

Everything I have achieved in life is something I dreamed of and fought for, which is why I am always self-motivated. I never give up on what I want. If we work together and you don’t see me achieving what I believe I can, time will prove otherwise, and you’ll realise I reached my goal. It’s your choice whether to support my ambition or be someone who didn’t contribute to my journey.

I prefer to stay quiet, as it helps me process information faster before reaching a conclusion. However, I’m always happy to share my ideas while developing them when needed. I can switch between logical and creative thinking, but I love seeing the tangible outcomes of my work. My favorite approach is structured creativity—a balanced blend of logic and innovation.

I dislike hearing the phrase “it’s complicated” because most complex problems can be broken down into smaller, manageable building blocks. Often, complexity reflects poor documentation or communication of the bigger picture. If someone underestimates me, I’ll try to prove them wrong, but I will move on from them quickly if they don’t support my growth.

I have a strong attention to details and can turn ambiguous goals into well-structured, sequential steps. I thrive on working toward clear targets and dislike uncertainty. I value honesty and have a knack for connecting pieces of information, even when they are presented over long periods. My focus doesn’t waver, even in lengthy, structured meetings.

I adapt my approach to suit the situation: I am introverted when working on technical tasks and extroverted when presenting or participating in meetings. This duality allows me to perform effectively in diverse environments.
