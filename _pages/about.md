Congratulations, you’ve found the perfect intersection between a personality hire and a hard worker! You might be wondering how that’s possible. Well, let me share a bit about myself: I was born in a small city in Egypt, and everything I’ve achieved so far has been a realisation of my dreams. As the older sister in my family, I had to always set high standards, and that drive has carried into my professional life.
Throughout my career, I've been consistently praised for my dedication and reliability. One of my standout qualities is my ability to navigate and save awkward meetings when conversations stall. Now, you might be thinking, ‘No one’s perfect—what’s the catch?’ Well, I do require visa sponsorship, but that’s just a footnote in an otherwise great story ;)
