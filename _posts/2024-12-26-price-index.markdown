**If you are like me and need to see the bigger picture, you might have heard of terms like price index, index funds, shares, and other financial concepts that are interconnected. I will start by exploring the price index and how it is created. But don’t worry—if you come from a data science background, I’ll tie the concepts to mathematics and statistics to make them technical friendly.**

> Decide on what to highlight later .. 

***Company Shares:*** Shares are units of ownership in a company. When you buy shares, you own a small part of that company. Shares of multiple companies often make up the components of a price index. There are two types of shares to focus on: those that are publicly traded on the market and those that are privately held by institutions or insiders

***Price Index:*** A price index is a tool commonly used to measure the performance of a group of financial assets—specifically stocks in this context—by tracking changes in their prices over time.

***Index Fund:*** An index fund is an investment vehicle that pools money to replicate the performance of a specific price index, such as the S&P 500 or the Russell Index. In simple terms, it allows you to invest in a group of stocks that make up an index you prefer, offering a diversified and cost-effective way to track the market.
