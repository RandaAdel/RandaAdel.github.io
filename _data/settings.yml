    designation: "Data Scientist, McKinsey "
    content: "I first knew Randa in the data science 9 month diploma by the information technology institute (ITI), and we worked later on several groups projects during our course work. We got both hired by the same telecom giant (Etisalat Egypt), and we cooperated on several projects during that time. What first caught my attention about Randa was her creativity and finding out of the box solutions. Whenever we studied a new subject she was very keen on getting to the depth of it with strong detailed oriented mindset. She also possessed strong programming skills and mathematical background. During our time in Etisalat Egypt, we collaborated on several projects such as recharges localisation, and recharge propensity models, during which, her organisation skills, business understanding and strong programming skills helped us finish the projects more quickly and efficiently. Aside from the technical skill, Randa's work ethics and agility are to be admired."
